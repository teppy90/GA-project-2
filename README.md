## Project Scope
Project Scope:
The purpose of this app is to create an online record of a user's books read. There is much potential for such an idea (see: goodreads.com), but knowing my abilities, the goal for this app is to be able to create a record of a book, access the record, edit it, and delete it.

## Technology utilized 
bootstrap css, jquery, node js, express, ejs, method-override, chai, bcrypt

Frameworks: MVC, CRUD 
Hosting platform: Heroku

## Difficulties / Limitation
I started out really lost, decided to follow a tutorial. It used mongoose for database development. I had trouble with creating the edit route when I decided I wanted login authentication and spent days trying out several methods. Although the practice helped me grow my overall understanding of MVC and full-stack applications, I still didn't have a sufficient depth of understanding of how creating routes on my own so I couldn't integrate the two features (login functionality and CRUD).

Referred to course recording on login authentication to successfully create one. Managed to figure out create route. For update, delete route needed the help of SJ who had consultation with TA for the same issue. Managed to create a working app that met MVP. 

Only limitation is how fast I grow my knowledge. Resources are readily available everywhere. Although, everything I ended up creating in this app was from what I learned in this course. Still, it was good to gain a broader understanding of how MVC can be created.

### UserStory 1
I am forced to #stayhome this circuit breaker and would like to keep track of the books I read. 

# Unsolved Problems
1. Able to access book records of other users on the app and exchange comments.
2. this is not the post mortem but a note that developing an ERD would have been good BEFORE the start of this project
